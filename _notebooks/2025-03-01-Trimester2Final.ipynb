    "# 3. Feature Write Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature 1: \n",
    "This was a pretty basic feature, I added a robot for Jupyter Notebooks, and it is an NPC. This feature was made really easy since the NPC class was already fully defined and it was just like copying a template. However, during this feature, I also helped fix the quiz ui by making it look a little nicer. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature 2: \n",
    "This was a little more complicated, but the overall feature was to create a meteor blaster game. We were at ease with creating the minigame, however getting the actual funcitonality was difficult. We struggled to get the keydown stuff working, and the projectil creation was also tricky. This feature is still in production and has bare functionality at the moment. I hope that this feature can shift over to trimester 3. This relates to the quiz because the initial concept was to answer questions in order to get projectiles to shoot. \n",

    "**My score on the FRQ:** 32/39\n",

    "\n",
    "**Arrays**: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Objects**: \n",
    "Even these questions, I understand the gist of objects and their creation. But, I forgot some of the nitty gritty details about every single word used in object creation, and I hope that after reviewing those, I will be set for the AP exam. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean Expression and If Statements**: \n",
    "For these questions, the ones with operators that ask about the conditions and when it is true or not really confuses me. I know that these should be easy, but I really need to review logic gates and how exactly the OR & AND stuff works. Hopefully this clarifies up after revision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aditionally, although I didn't do the FRQ portion, I took a look and felt that I definitely wasn't fully prepared for it. I had a general idea of what to do, but I don't think I would be able to perform well during the actual FRQ. Some of the FRQ walkthroughs really worked well for me during team teaches, and I hope that we can do more of those in the future. In the meantime, I too will try to work through more FRQs. \n"

    "Over the past few months, I have been working on a personal project called TeluguTunes. It is a website which aims to spread piano sheet music from telugu-language songs. I arrange each of the music pieces myself, and plan on putting these on my website for people to download and play. Although this website is still in the works, I find that it strongly resonates with the stuff we do in CSA, since I took heavy inspiration from the CSA websites. Rather than hardcoding everything, I've been trying to use node.js (trying something new) along with sqlite to store the music pieces in a backend rather than hardcoding everything. \n",

    "# 6. Self Reflection: \n",
    "1. 5 Things I did:\n",
    "    I believe that I deserve a 5/5 on this section, as I have made some pretty big contributions to this class. I find that I have outlined them pretty well, and that my list at the top of the page sums them up really well. Aditionally, I think some of my points are pretty unique, like helping Hithin with CSP\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Full Stack Feature Demo\n",
    "    I believe that I deserve a 1.5/2 on this section, mainly because one of my features is still in production and not completed. I wish I was able to get to completing it, however it didn't happen. Besides this, I think the rest of this section is good\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Write Up: \n",
    "    I believe that I deserve a 1/1 on this section, as I made multiple draw.io diagrams to visualize my features. Some advice that I took from Mr. Mort and hope to use later as well is to fully draw out my features before executing them. I didn't do this at the beginning, which created complications for me, but making the draw.io diagram REALLY helped. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. CB MC/FRQ: \n",
    "    I believe that  I deserve a 1/1 for this section, as I finished the MCQ genuinely. I guess something better that I could have done is doing the FRQ as well, however I skimmed over it and know that I definitely need to practice more. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. This is probably a section that I am most proud about, from working on this project for a prety short amount of time, I've learned that when you do something you like, the commits follow.     After just a little bit of work, my contributions skyrocket, and this was a similar case to adventure_game. THe main thing I am happy about is that I can use CSA knowledge to help me on this project. \n",
