    "**My score on the FRQ:** 32/39\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I am satisfied with this score as I haven't really studied much for the AP exam yet. Although it is not that great, there is still room for improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "### My Areas for Improvement: \n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Objects: \n",
    "Even these questions, I understand the gist of objects and their creation. But, I forgot some of the nitty gritty details about every single word used in object creation, and I hope that after reviewing those, I will be set for the AP exam. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean Expression and If Statements: \n",
    "For these questions, the ones with operators that ask about the conditions and when it is true or not really confuses me. I know that these should be easy, but I really need to review logic gates and how exactly the OR & AND stuff works. Hopefully this clarifies up after revision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aditionally, although I didn't do the FRQ portion, I took a look and felt that I definitely wasn't fully prepared for it. I had a general idea of what to do, but I don't think I would be able to perform well during the actual FRQ. Some of the FRQ walkthroughs really worked well for me during team teaches, and I hope that we can do more of those in the future. In the meantime, I too will try to work through more FRQs. \n"
