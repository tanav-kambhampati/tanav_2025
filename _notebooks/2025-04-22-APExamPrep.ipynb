    "\n",
    "I spent a lot of time on GeeksforGeeks, which is a treasure trove of programming resources. Specifically, I used it to:\n",
    "- Review Java basics and OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "- Explore sorting/searching algorithms in more detail.\n",
    "- Understand how recursion works through visual examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I got stuck or needed a deeper explanation, this site really helped clarify things.\n",

    "\n",
    "When in doubt, I asked questions in class or during office hours. Mr. Mortenson was super helpful in explaining:\n",
    "- How to approach FRQs logically.\n",
    "- The best way to structure Java methods and classes.\n",
    "- Which topics to focus on most for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don‚Äôt underestimate how helpful it is to just ask your teacher. Even a quick 2-minute conversation can clear up a lot of confusion.\n",
