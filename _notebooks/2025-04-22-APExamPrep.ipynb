    "# 4 types of collegeboard questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods and Control Structures** \n",
    "These questions require writing independent methods that utilize loops, conditionals, return statements, and parameters. I practiced this format thoroughly with methods such as findFreeBlock, numberOfLines, and getLines, all of which incorporate nested loops and logical conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes**\n",
    "This type of FRQ involves creating or completing a class that includes constructors, fields, and various methods. My experience with AppointmentBook and Sign reflects this practice. I constructed full class definitions with constructors, instance variables, and supporting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array/ArrayList**\n",
    "These questions will evaluate my skills in iterating through, modifying, and accessing elements in Arrays or ArrayLists. Beyond the examples listed, I worked through College Board FRQs and review questions focused on tasks like shifting elements, conditional deletion, and frequency counting. I simulated testing conditions by timing myself and scoring with official AP rubrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2D Array**\n",
    "This section tests proficiency with nested loop patterns and correct indexing within two-dimensional arrays. I strengthened these skills by solving problems such as SeatingChart, and ArrayResizer, all drawn from College Board FRQs and prep resources. These exercises were key for mastering loop nesting and boundary logic."

    "- Read through each chapter thoroughly.\n",
    "- Highlighted key Java concepts and syntax rules.\n",
    "- Took handwritten notes to reinforce concepts like inheritance, ArrayLists, recursion, and sorting algorithms.\n",

    "I practiced as many FRQs as I could find—both from past AP exams and review books. This helped me:\n",
    "- Get comfortable with the format of the exam.\n",
    "- Learn how to approach problems under time pressure.\n",
    "- Strengthen my ability to write methods that manipulate arrays, ArrayLists, and classes.\n",

    "- Review Java basics and OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "- Explore sorting/searching algorithms in more detail.\n",
    "- Understand how recursion works through visual examples.\n",
